# Agario
An analogue of the game agario.

# Playing the Game
this is a game in which bacterial cells move around, absorb food pellets, and also eat each other.
the game ends when you are absorbed by another player, in our case by bot.
The essence of the game is to absorb other players and become the biggest bacteria.
